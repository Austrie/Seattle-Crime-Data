# Executive Summary
## Background:
We are presented with statistics of Seattle's crime information. One dataset provided is the crime rate for 1996 to 2007, and the other is from 2008 to 2014
## What we hope to find:
* Overall crime rate difference between 1996-2007 and 2008-2014
* Rate of overall crime increase from 1996 to the present
* Rate of crime increase for each individual crime from 1996 to 2014
* Seasonal trends in crime for 2008 to 2014
## What we found:
* There wasn't a major year-by-year trend
* For both violent and theft-related crimes, there was a major drop in number of crimes (37% and 46% respectively) between 2005 and 2006
    * Crime was significantly higher in 1996 to 2005, then suddenly dropped in 2006 and stayed low ever since.
* There was approximately fifteen times more theft related crimes to violent crimes each given year
    * 14.8x more theft crimes than violent crimes (Median)
    * 15.0x more theft crimes than violent crimes (average)
* Between 1996 and 2005 (inclusive), the average number of crimes was ~99,106 crimes
    * Between 1996 and 2005 (inclusive), the average number of theft-related crimes was ~92,375 crimes
    * Between 1996 and 2005 (inclusive), the average number of violent crimes was ~6,731 crimes
* Between 2006 and 2014 (inclusive), the average of number crimes was ~34,357 crimes
    * Between 2006 and 2014 (inclusive), the average number of theft-related crimes was ~32,384 crimes
    * Between 2006 and 2014 (inclusive), the average number of violent crimes was ~1,972 crimes
* For 2008 to 2014, there was a slight increase in crime during the middle of each year (i.e. summer time)
## Sociological Hypothesis:
My major conclusion after viewing this dataset is that, assuming no data was lost after 2005, a major law(s) was implemented that impacted crime rates (either directly or indirectly) in between 2005 and 2006. Either a law that deterred criminals or helped the poor and mentally-unstable.
